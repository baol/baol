Hi,
I'm a free software developer and activist interested in complex algorithms, operations research, and security. I was also an early member and co-founder of the [LILiK](http://www.lilik.it) free software lab, but this happened in the previous millennium.

You can take a look at my research on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rc-liiQAAAAJ&hl=en) or find my latest project *Z-Wave fun with an Hack-RF* [here](https://github.com/baol/waving-z).

I should also mention some older projects: a fast and flicker free PDF presentaion visualizer [PDFCube](https://github.com/baol/pdfcube) and a framework for metaheuristics algorithms that I used in my paper on VRP and was also used to develop the [Routist](http://www.routist.com) fleet optimization engine when I founded the KKT startup a few years ago, [METSlib](https://github.com/coin-or/metslib).

I have developed some expertise in location optimization and location algorithms and am now working [here](http://here.com).

I also write about what I do from time to time:

{% for item in site.texts do %}
  * [{{ item.title }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ item.url }})
{% endfor %}

Most receltly I'm starting to sharpen my [cooking and baking skills](cooking.md)
