Hi,
as long as the internet is involved, I'm a free software developer and activist interested in complex algorithms, operations research, and security. I was also an early member and co-founder of the [LILiK](http://www.lilik.it) free software lab, but this happened in the previous millennium.

You can take a look at my research on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rc-liiQAAAAJ&hl=en).

You can find my latest project here:
* [Z-Wave fun with an Hack-RF](https://github.com/baol/waving-z)

And other older projects:
* [PDFCube - fast, flicker free PDF presentation visualizer (horrible code from ages ago)](https://github.com/baol/pdfcube)
* [METSlib - a fast framework and toolkit to build metaheuristics](https://github.com/baol/metslib)
